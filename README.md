# Chocolate GL Quake
Chocolate GL Quake intends to create a stable, well commented code base to serve as a good starting point for other projects. To that end, there won't be any new features added to this port. 

## Documentation
In addition to the source code there will be a manual, tutorials and API reference created to support it. For more info on this, check out the Quake Codex website:

## Planned Features
- Fix all compiler warnings (In progress)
- Remove dead code, blank functions, etc.
- Fix known bugs
